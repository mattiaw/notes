PART III – NARRATIVE

 

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Forms 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, NBSAR, N-CSR, or the transition report or portion thereof, 
could not be filed within the prescribed time period. (Attach extra sheets if needed)


 

As disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 14, 2020, (the “Form 8-K”), 
the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company, determined, based on the recommendation of management and in consultation with CohnReznick LLP (“CohnReznick”), the 
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, that the Company’s financial statements which were included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2018, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, and September 30, 2018 and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the 
quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019 (“Non-Reliance Periods”) should no longer be relied upon due to an error in such financial statements 
relating to the Company’s recognition of revenue from contracts with customers under ASC Topic 606. Similarly, CohnReznick’s reports on the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2018, management’s reports on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, press releases, and investor 
communications describing the Company’s financial statements for such periods should no longer be relied upon. 

 

The Company intends to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019 Form 10-K”), restated financial statements and other 
disclosures for the Non-Reliance Periods as soon as reasonably practical. As a result of the pending restatements of such financial statements, and the fact that 
the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 cannot be finalized until the restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods are completed, 
the Company was unable to complete its financial statements and file its 2019 Form 10-K by the prescribed due date for such filing (March 16, 2020) without unreasonable effort or expense.
